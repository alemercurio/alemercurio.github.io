We take full advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the design process of a new, small bipedal robot. We train it in a varied design space simultaneously, directly comparing different parametrizations of its limbs. As a result, we present an optimized design proposal for a small bipedal robot and a design framework for continuing its development.
