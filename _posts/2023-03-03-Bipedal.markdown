We aim at taking full advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the design process of a new, small bipedal robot, with the goal of analysing which parameters should be chosen for highest performance and efficiency. Bipedal locomotion is still a challenge in robotics and current work in designing bipeds is mostly experience-based and nature-inspired. We aim at augmenting the informa-
tion that the designer has available when choosing how to parameterize a new robot by expanding the nominal design to a varied design space and training the robot in all of its different configurations simultaneously. The obtained policies can be used
for evaluation and comparison without the need to retrain them for every single design, helping the engineer to expedite and optimize the design process towards a bipedal robot and at the same time providing insights on how such a robot should be designed in the first place. As a result, we present a design proposal for a small bipedal robot and a design framework for continuing its development.
